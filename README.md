# Werewolf
## Gather around a TV and join on your phone to play this classic hidden-role party game

## Instructions

1. Navigate to server directory
2. Run `npm install` to install packages specified in `package.json`
3. Run `node server.js` to start server

1. Navigate to client directory
2. Run `npm install` to install packages specified in `package.json`
3. Run `run npm start` to start client

## Notes

Use two seperate terminals to run client and server.
Navigate to http: http://localhost:3000/
Try to write your own functional component in a new file, 
import into SharedScreen.js and inject into JSX (HTML looking stuff).
You could also try writing your own server side function and call from client side.
Have fun!
